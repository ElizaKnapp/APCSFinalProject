SPACE INVADERS

Space Dolphins

Rachel Xiao, Eliza Knapp

This project is a version of the game Space Invaders done in processing. It is an interactive game where the player controls the shooter by moving it left and right with the arrow keys. When the spacebar is clicked, a bullet is shot upwards towards a group of aliens. The goal of the game is to shoot all of the aliens before they get to the player or before the player loses all three of its lives. Aliens can also shoot bullets to kill the player. A player can hide behind barriers to avoid these bullets, but barriers slowly disappear when bullets hit them. When you shoot aliens, you get points, so another goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.
